###Scrum Practice Provides Better Business Value(Recoup(Something Lost/Expended) Cost Sooner & Lessen Overall Investment).Reduce Risk:Create A Product Thet Is Ready To Ship At Any Moment.More Transparency: Convey The Teams True Status To Project StackHolders.

###Done Simple Definition:Done Means It Is Live In Production & My Customer Use It.Commitment:Commiting To A Specific Amount Of Work At The Begining Of Each Sprint.Cross-Functional Team Works Closely Together,Increasing Their Overall Capability.Sprint Is The HeartBeat Of Scrum.HappilyDeliveringHappyness.
####Impact Mapping Concentrate Goal/Vision->Relavant People Called Actors->Impact To Behavior Of These Actor->Features Of The Software Called Deliverables.Maximum Impact By Minimum Deliverables.

###What Is Being Agile?People Collaborating Together To Solve A Problem Or Achieve A Goal At A Sustainable Pace.Its A Culture Of Purpose & Continuous Improvement.Three Aspects Of Product Development:Customer Needs[Are We Building The Right Product?],High Quality[Are We Building The Product Right?],Learnability[Are We Learning Faster About Our Product As Well As Our Ability].Humans Are Inherently Agile[Inspect,Adapt] But Transparency Takes Time And We Need Forum To Learn Continuously.
###Fixed Time Fixed Cost Complex Project[If Scope Is Fixed Then It's A Fixed Bid Project].
###1.Incremental & Iterative Delivery[Create The Crux Of Deliverables RockSolid].2.Frequent Customer Feedback:Get Feedback From Real End User To Check Right Direction.Improve The Quality Of Product.3.Continuous Planning & Improvement:What Should Be Included Or Excluded From Final Release Based On Customer Feedback.4.Flow&Emergent Design:Not Available UpFront,Emerged During Continuous Planning & Improvement.Ability To Respond To Changes.Improve Quality Of Product & People.5.Continuous Planning To Improve Predictibility.6.Autonomous& CrossFunctional Team: Freedom To Make Their Decision & Have All Capilities Together.Autonomous To Improve Self-Organization(Everything That Need To Be Done Within A Team Must Be Managed By The Team,No OutSiders).CrossFunctional To Improve Collaboration.
###Agile Is The Philosophy That Believes That People Need To Believe In Purpose & Collaborate To Achieve It.When They Collaborate They Build A Process That Is Transparent Enough To Help Them Inspect The Progress They Have Made With Respect To The Goal & Adapt Themselves(Process&Plan Accordingly).
###Empirical Process: Decisions Are Made Based On Observation & Experimentation Rather Than On Detailed UpFront Planning.Scrum,Kanban,Xp(Extreme Programming),Lean,Less(Large Scale Scrum),Dsdm(Dynamic System Development Method),DabbaWala In Mumbai All Are Following Agile Philosophy With Different GuideLine.   

####Any Empirical Process That Demonstrate These Characteristics Will Help The Teams Deliver High Quality Products That Meet Customer Need At A Sustainable Pace.BusinessDynamics(S(trength)W(eakness)O(pportunity)T(hreat)).Apply These Agile Principles &Values Considering Business Dynamics & Organizational Constraint.Then Inspect &Adapt.

####People->Have Problem(Setup Goals)->Needs Created(Requirement Created)->Solutions(Product/Problem Solution Fit/App/Service/Project).Organization Adoption Of A Process Means Organization Have Problem,Want To Move From Current State To Improved State.Can Be Done By Any Process[Choose Process That Best Fits Your Purpose/Sustainable Pace].Purpose Of Change/Shared Need For Change:Depicted By Prime Change Canvas:See PrimeChangeCanvasTemplate & PrimeChangeCanvasExample01.Find The Purpose,Goal To Achieve/Root Of The Problem By Chinese 5 Why/5 How Technique.
###Cost Of Delay:Cost Of Building Wrong Product Incurred From The Sunk Cost,Relearning Cost,Cost Of Rework,Cost Of Oppotunity Lost,Penalties,Brand Image Lose & Defer Validating Those Assumption Until Last Minute.
###ReturnOfInvestment=(Gain From Investment-Cost Of Investment)/Cost Of Investment.Sustainable Pace:The Pace At Which Developers Are Comfortably Delivering The Quality Solution,Pace At Which Customers/StakeHolders Are Happy Consuming Product Feature That Solve Their Probem,Pace At Which Sponsors Are Happy Getting Return On Their Investment.
###Our Mind Substitute Many Details For Simple Concept With Leaps Of Abstraction.Implicit Mental Models Remain Untested.Mental Models:MentalModelsForAgileAdoption.pdf.[Mental Model Guide Our Action->Governing Variables Drive Action Strategies->Inntended/UnInntended Consequence Of Action].Solution Change Our Governing Variables.
###Changing Mental Models:"Regardless Of What We Discover,We Understand & Truly Believe That Everyone Did The Best Job He/She Could,Given What Was Known At The Time,His/Her Skills & Abilities,The Resources Available,And The Situation At Hand." 
###System Thinking:A System Is A Group Of Parts That Form A Complex & Unified Whole & Has The Following Characteristics:•Parts Are Interdependent & All Parts Must Be Present To Carry Out Its Purpose Optimally.•Parts Need To Interact With Each Other & Are Arranged In A Specific Way To Carry Out Its Purpose.•Group Of Parts Has A Unique Characteristic That Parts Individually Don’t Have.An Organization Is A System Made Up Of Groups,Functions That Are Interdependent & Interact With Each Other To Deliver A Product Or A Service.Or Simply Is The Process Of Looking Into The Big Picture & Identify Both Intended/Unintended Consequences Of An Action & Making Decision Considering Both ShortTerm/LongTerm Consequences Of The Decision.  
####Identify Why(Vision) System Need To Change->Who Can Help To Change The System(Contributor Provides Contribution)->How They Can Contribute->What Changes Required To System Under What Constraint To Enable Transformation. It Like Impact Mapping,Called Change Mapping[Mapping Of Process Changes To Vision].
###Problem Domain->Solution Domain->Action With Intended/UnIntended Consequence(ActionConsequence.png)+Constraint.
####Systems Thinking The Process Of Looking At Big Picture To Identify Both Intended(Expected)&Unintended(Unexpected) Consequences Of An Action & Making A Decision While Considering Both Short-Term & Long-Term Consequences Of The Decision.Fidelity Mockup:The Degree Of Exactness With Which Something Is Copied/Reproduced For Mocking.Requirement Triage:Decide The Order Of The Treatment For Requirement.CostOfProduction:All Cost Related To Production Release.Value Stream Mapping:Every Task In A Project As Stream Of Activities That Add Value To End Goal.
###Cost Of Production:It Is The Cost Of Building Products Like Salaries,Cost Of Licenses,Infrastructure.To Identify Waste:Defects,Overhead Processes,Waiting Time,No Empiricism,Transportation(Hand Offs),Inventory(Undone Work Adds No Value),Motion(Context Switch).Mental Model:Mental Model Is An Image Of Someone/Something That We Create In Our Mind Based On What We Learn From Our Surroundings That Drives Our Behavior & Judgment.Can Be Chnaged Using Experience,Stepping Into Others Shoes,Interactions,Data, Observation,Experiment,Understanding Constraints.
####Every Procedure Has Purpose,If We Understand The Purpose Behind The Process/Procedure We Will Follow It Or Will Find A Better Procedure To Achieve The Goal/Purpose.PRIME Leadership Framework.
